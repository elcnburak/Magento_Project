# Magento Demo Site
## Description
Magento is one of the world's most popular e-commerce platforms, offering both free and paid versions. "Magento Open Source" is a completely free and open-source platform that can be used for e-commerce sites of all scales. It provides essential e-commerce functionalities and numerous customization options. On the other hand, "Magento Commerce" is a paid platform offering more features and functionalities, making it ideal for enterprise-level e-commerce sites.

Renowned for its open-source nature and free availability, Magento is suitable for creating e-commerce sites ranging from small stores to large marketplaces. It boasts features such as product management, catalog management, payment and delivery options, order management, customer management, marketing, and SEO capabilities.
